This course is mainly about systems and we won't go deep
on the learning perspectives. Here are useful materials to get you started.

More materials will be posted throughout the course.

## Materials on Deep Learning
- [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is a comprehensive material for the field.
- [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is a great course to get started on DL for vision.
- [Dive into Deep Learning](http://en.diveintodeeplearning.org/) is an interactive open source book with code, math, and discussions.
